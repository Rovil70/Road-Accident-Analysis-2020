## 📌 Objective

To analyze the road accident trends, causes, and impact across different Indian states and predict accident severity using Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Source

- Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Government of India
- Format: CSV
- Year: 2020

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (for data querying)
- Power BI (for dashboards)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing/null values
- Standardized column names
- Converted data types
- Resolved duplicate entries

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- State-wise and month-wise accident trends
- Cause of accidents and their impact
- Fatalities vs Non-fatal accidents
- Age and gender-based impact

### 3. Visualization
- Bar Charts, Heatmaps, Pie Charts using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Power BI dashboard for interactive insights

### 4. Machine Learning
- **Model**: Logistic Regression / Random Forest (customizable)
- **Target**: Predict accident severity (Minor, Major, Fatal)
- **Accuracy**: ~85% (with tuning)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
